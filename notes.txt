nothing worthwhile loaded: blank / black and white text, if any.
 - need to figure out how to diable the console and splash screen

loaded with software but some services not working: RED with list of services not working
 - we can test if a node has been provisioned/claimed by a server by checking the existence of /opt/easy-rsa/easyrsa3/easyrsa/client-node.crt
 - the presense of this crt means it was placed there by an iot server (provisioned)
 
 - sudo systemctl list-units --system --all | grep amya             can be used to list the status of the services

loaded and not provisioned: RED with good IP address (if DHCP worked) and message saying "ready for provisioning"
 - again, we use the presence of the client-node certificate to know if it has been provisioned 
 - 

provisioned but not connected to network: RED with local link IP. and message saying <:equpment_model> and maybe other provision tags.
 - we probably want to display the server hostname that has claimed the node.  it can be found in /opt/amya/configs/pickled.config.json.

everything hunky dory : GREEN, good IP, clock, no error messages.
 - it can be asssumed that the node is connected and communicating with the server if the amya-publish-pickled.service is active and running
